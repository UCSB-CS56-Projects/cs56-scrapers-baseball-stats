NEW Issues:

Change the location of instructions for creating a fantasy team:
Right now, the instructions for creating a fantasy team take up a lot of room on the left side of the stat window.  Think of a better place to put them, where they wont take up so much space.

Merge Windows
Right now, a new window pops up every time a player is searched for, whenever a fantasy team is created, and whenever a row in the stat window is clicked. Furthermore, a new window pops up when the "Load demo stats" button is clicked. Change the UI so that all of this happens within the same window.
