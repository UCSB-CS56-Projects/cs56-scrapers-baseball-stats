(a) This program takes in raw XML data from the MLB servers and organizes it into a table which features different statistics of various baseball players. You can then choose nine players to create a fantasy team and see all of their stats in one window. 

(b) A set of user stories that describe what the software can do: 
* As a user, I can view an average of different game statistics for baseball players so that I can create the ideal fantasy team. 
* As a user, I can enter the IDs of nine players so that I can add them to my fantasy team. 
* As a user, I can search up a player so I don't have to scroll through the entire list. 
* As a user, I can view a popup window of all of my fantasy team player's statistics so that I have the information for all my players. 
* As a user, I can double click on a user to see their stats in a popup window. 

(c) The software runs. It pulls the XML data from nine different games which have been included in the stats/DemoFiles folder instead of pulling from the MLB servers for the purpose of the demo. The software allows you to enter the ID’s of nine different players. It doesn’t verify if you entered ID’s that actually exist or if you just entered random numbers. It then creates a pop up window which features all the stats of the players that you selected in one place. It also allows you to click on a player to create a pop up of their stats. The program doesn’t let you delete players from your list. It seems that if you want to start over, you need to rerun the program. 

(d) A set of user stories that could be added: 
* As a user, after I enter an ID I want it to tell me if that player exists or not (since the program currently just ignores IDs that don't exist) so that I know that it didn't count towards my nine players or I entered an ID wrong. 
* As a user, I want immediate feedback of my growing list of players as I add them to the list so that I can see if I added the correct players. 
* As a user, I want to be able to remove players so I don't have to start all over again each time. 

(e) The README.md file doesn't have anything about the functionality of the fantasy team. The README.md file also does mention that they are pulling data from the stats/DemoFiles folder for the demo, but doesn't mention how to pull the stats from the MLB servers. 

(f) There are appropriate comments and descriptions in the build.xml file so when we run ant -p all of the targets show up. The build.xml file is also well documented so it is easy to separate the targets from each other, and understand what each of the targets are doing. If you really wanted to add more comments about the tasks in the build.xml file, you could, but it’s not necessary and the current state of the build.xml is very good. 

(g) There are five issues currently open. The first issues is to “Make a better GUI using another party” and is worth 300 points. The second issue is to merge the pop up windows, so that all of the output is displayed on one window (worth 400 points). The third issue is to change the location of the instructions so they don’t take up as much space (100 points). The fourth issue is to use the Split class to view an advanced statistics window (worth 300 points). And the last issue is to resort to less global variables (250 points). There are enough issues to earn 1000 points. The issues themselves are only clear to a certain extent on what needs to be accomplished. The first issue of “Make a better GUI” using another party is clear that either SwingX or JavaFX needs to be used, but it doesn’t really define what a “better GUI” would be, so it’s mostly up to the interpretation of the coders. The second and third issues are clear. The fourth issue seems clear, but also seems to need a little more research and the last issue is clear, but seems to need a lot of rewritten code.

(i) Looking in the source directory, we have a class for each element of the application. Each class has appropriate comments that help guide developers through the code, describing each method. Instance variables are self-defining, and simple to understand. In some classes (namely SearchPlayer), there is some code commented out without much explanation. Looking through it, it may be for testing

The main function is in Main.java, which creates the main window (a fairly simple JFrame[MainWindow] with a fairly simple JPanel[MainPanel]), along with two other objects, statReader (which will take in and and parse XML files [with the help of the XMLContentHandler class], and creates a statManager) and statKeeper (retains data sorted by statReader, and processed by statManager). statManager, takes in data from statReader, and changes players’ stats accordingly in statKeeper. statKeeper contains an array of Player objects, which hold information on games each player played, included in the XML file. Stats are calculated using various helper classes, such as Statistic and StatisticCalculator. In the MainPanel, you can click a button which will then load up the processed statistics (supposedly from MLB servers, but in this demo, provided XML files) and display them in a new JFrame[StatWindow]. This StatWindow has a main widget, StatTable, which stores Player stats in a somewhat user-friendly manner. StatWindow also has various widgets that inform users how to created a fantasy team, create a fantasy team, search up a player, or individually look at players stats.


(j) Looking through the github folder, there are currently test classes which utilize JUnit for eight of the twelve classes. The four files for which there currently aren’t tests are Main.java, MainPanel.java, MainWindow.java, and SearchPlayer.java. For the classes where JUnit tests were implemented, each test has a heading with a description of what part of the class the JUnit test is targeted towards. For example, for the SplitTest class, the test case for the calculateBB method is labeled with the method signature of the method. After running “ant test”, all of the tests passed. There were up to 19 tests for each class. Overall, after looking through the testing classes, the JUnit tests that were already written seemed really thorough. Each test class tested all of the methods in the class it was designated for at least once. Additionally, the tests were all unit tests, meaning they tested only one part of the code at a time. However, there was room for expansion. Regarding the tests classes for which tests were already written, even though each method was tested at least once, there did not seem to be extensive testing for errors or special cases. Therefore, one way to expand is to add tests to these preexisting test classes. Further, there are four classes that are left untested. Looking at the Main.java class, there are only a few basic set up type commands, but nothing that could really be tested for variable values.However, the one class for which there are no JUnit tests which would benefit from testing is the SearchPlayer.java file. This class saves the players, but none of the saving/implementation of JFrame is tested. The way I would expand on the testing done in this project is by first expanding by testing for the “save players” part of the SearchPlayers class. In particular, there is a complete nest of if statements which haven’t been tested at all, which could have potential for a lot of errors, so that’s where I would start writing more tests.
