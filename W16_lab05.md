(a) The project is an interface that allows the user to view individual baseball players' statistics, such as home runs, batting average, on base percentage, and more.

(b) As a manager, I can view my players statistics, so that I can determine my starting roster.
As a recruiter, I can look at players' statistics so that I can make the judgement call on who to draft.
As a player, I can view my statistics so that I can see what I need to improve on.

(c) The project does NOT compile.  The error we are having is:
/fs/student/kctoombs/cs56/cs56-w16-lab05/cs56-scrapers-baseball-stats/build.xml:30: Unable to find a javac compiler;
com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath.
Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK.
It is currently set to "/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.71-1.b15.fc22.x86_64/jre"

(d) As an opposing team's coach, I would like to be able to see the stats of other teams' starting rosters, so that I can prepare a gameplan.
As a statistical analyst, I would like to be able to view a specific statistic that is sorted by player from high to low, so that I can determine the top players foreach team.
As a fan, I would like to be able to view pitchers' statistics, so that I can decide which game I want to go to based on who is pitching that game.

(e) There is not a ton of information or detail about the project, just a brief overview. It would be more helpful if there were a few more screenshots of the current state of the GUI, so that we can actually see what it does and see what we are starting with.  It would also be more helpful if the README included descriptions of the functionality of the program; the description is pretty vague thus far.

(f) The header comments are outdated, and need to be changed. There is no description for the clean target. The comments that are already include in the build.xml file are helpful, but a few more wouldn't hurt. There are currently no comments in the compile, run, or clean sections.

(g) The total points that can be earned from the current issues is 1750 points. The descriptions of the issues are clear as far as what needs to be done to implement them.

(i)  This project is an interface to view the statistics of Baseball players, such as: At-Bats, Batting Averages, On-Base Percentage, Singles, Doubles, Triples, etc. The code is organized well so far, but because we are unable to run the project, it is difficult to see how the classes come together to see the finished product.  However, it is rather clear how the classes relate to one another. For example, it is clear that each Player will have several Statistics and that the StatManager will be able to manipulate and display the statistics of individual Players. Also, it is clear that Splits will be Statistics, but more detailed.  The code is particularly easy to understand because a lot of it is getters and setters.  A lot of the classes implement ArrayLists because of their simple functionality.  This should allow us to sort players by name, easily add/delete players, or easily access certain statistics. As far as graphics are concerned, it appears that the GUI so far only includes a JFrame and JPanel, as well as a default button with a label.  There is also an image on the panel, the image of the baseball field and the baseball.

(j)  This project came with a lot of test coverage, of which tests each class. The tests are pretty thorough because they test the constructors as well as other methods.  The project came with Junit tests, for every class (besides main), so we should be able to get the program running smoothly rather soon.  Soon  we will be adding to this project, so we will also be adding more test cases.
