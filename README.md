The program parses through raw .xml data retrieved from MLB servers and organizes the data into player statistics. These new, organized stats can then be viewed from the GUI. For the purposes of this demo, the program loads in data from 9 different games which have been included in the .jar. You can view them [here](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/cs56/issues/0000785/browse/src/edu/ucsb/cs56/S12/sbaldwin/baseball/Stats/DemoFiles/).
