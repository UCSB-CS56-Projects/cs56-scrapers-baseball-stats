# cs56-scrapers-baseball-stats

This is a simple MLB baseball statistics program. 

The program parses through raw .xml data retrieved from MLB servers and organizes the data into player statistics. These new, organized stats can then be viewed from the GUI. For the purposes of this demo, the program loads in data from 9 different games which have been included under the `stats/DemoFiles` folder.

The files were downloaded from [gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/)

## Usage

To run the GUI, simply type `ant run` after cloning the code. You will see a window like this
